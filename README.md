# Classification-Problem
Classification Problem (using various Machine Learning algorithms)
Thesis:
•	This dataset is about a newly launched bike and it has taken the information from promotional campaign and from their social network website.
•	We has to predict which customers will purchase this bike or not.
•	I had used all the machine learning models on this dataset and I hope this will be helpful for most of them as you can find various algorithms and their visualizations at one place.
. I actually worked in Spyder 3.6 version but I had downloaded the file in both .py & .ipynb
